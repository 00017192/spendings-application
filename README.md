# Nizomov - Your expenses tracker

This project was build for expenses manager, where you can update your expense items, editing its:

- date (in proper format dd/mm/yyyy)
- name of the company (vendor), where you spent money on
- tags of the company (vendor), such as categories
- price (only decimals)

In order to start running the application, you hav to type in terminal the following code:

`npm start`

and the go to browser and type into search input

`https://localhost:3000`

where 3000 is the PORT of my application, that has been set in package.json file

I use couple of packages, such as:
- ejs (template engine)
- express-validator (validator for form inputs0)
- nodemon (nodemon that inits my localhost)
- serve-favicon (to add favicon to the browser)
- uniqid (for generating unique id of an expense item)

Hope you will find my web application system useful, this is just the 1.0.0 version
